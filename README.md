# EULERPB1
This is a generalized solution to the Euler project's first problem which is as follows: 

"If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000."

I thought that it would be more interesting to create a solution that generalizes this so that you can use any range (not just 1 to 1000) and you can use any series of factors of your choice (not just 3 or 5).
